 * The HTTP API and Socket.IO share one allow-list (CORS_ORIGIN), so a new
 * deployment origin is only ever added in one place.
 *
 * This is a matcher rather than the plain array `cors` would happily accept,
 * because the two things that actually break a deployment are not spelling
 * mistakes — they are shape mismatches the eye slides straight over:
 *
 *  - A pasted origin carrying a trailing slash ("https://admin.example.com/")
 *    is never equal to what the browser sends, which has no path at all.
 *  - A Vercel or Netlify preview build gets a brand-new hostname on every
 *    push, so no fixed list can contain the URL the tester is looking at.
 *
 * Both sides are therefore normalised, and a list entry may use `*` in place
 * of one hostname label: "https://*.vercel.app".
